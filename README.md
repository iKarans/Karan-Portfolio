# Karan's Portfolio

![Portfolio Project](https://github.com/iKarans/Karan-Portfolio/blob/main/iPortfolio.png)


## Introduction
A website ,that showcases my personal projects and projects that I worked on during the _nology course, desgined using HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript using a mobile-first.

The website is split into four sections: Home, About, Portfolio, Contact. On the home/landing page, you will see a typewriter animation looping through saying hello in different languages. The background is made using <a href="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/" target="_blank">particles.js</a> to give a space theme. The quote above the memoji is fetched from an <a href="https://github.com/iKarans/Anime-Quotes-API" target="_black">API</a> that I created from scratch (Although currently it is hosted on my local server ðŸ˜ž). You can navigate through the sections by scrolling or clicking the corresponding section in the nav bar. The About section gives a brief introduction about my background and lists my skills and tech stack. The portfolio section displays all the projects that I have worked on using a flip card. To get more information on the project, hover over the flip card which has a rocket icon and a code icon which takes you to the hosted site and github source code respectively. You will also see a brief summary about the project and the tools used as well. You can also filter the projects by language. Finally, the contact section has links to my socials and CV (Work In Progress) which can be accessed by clicking on each of the icons. If you are on a desktop, they can also be found in the nav bar.
