# Karan's Portfolio

## Introduction
A website ,that showcases my personal projects and projects that I worked on during the _nology course, desgined using HTML, SCSS, CSS and Javascript using a mobile-first.

The website is split into four sections: Home, About, Portfolio, Contact. On the home/landing page, you will see a typewriter animation looping through saying hello in different languages. The background is made using <a href="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/" target="_blank">particles.js</a> to give a space vibe. The quote above the memoji is fetched from an <a href="https://github.com/iKarans/Anime-Quotes-API" target="_black">API</a> that I created from scratch. You can move from the home page to the about page by clicking the "Let's explore", About in the nav bar or simply by scrolling down.
